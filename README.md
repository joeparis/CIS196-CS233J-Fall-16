## Academic Honesty ##

Helping, or being helped by, another student during an exam will be considered a breach of academic honesty and is grounds for receiving a zero grade and/or failing the course among other possible remedies as outlined in the [Students' Rights and Responsibilities Handbook](https://www.linnbenton.edu/current-students/administration-information/policies/students-rights-responsibilities-and-conduct).
