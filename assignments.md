# Assignment 1 - Miss Baker
This first assignment is meant to ease you into back into things. Using the text and image provided in the `miss_baker` directory of this repo create a web page using symantic HTML. Be sure to mark up the page fully and don't be afraid of over complicating it. Visit the [MDN HTML Element Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) to refresh your memory. Look for opportunities to use tags you never have before.

Also, style your page using CSS. Again, the [MDN CSS page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) is your friend. Apply styles to format the page. Try adding dropcaps or extra large first letters where they seem appropriate. Use CSS to make interesting changes to your page such as adding animations or transitions. Do you remember how to use transform? Translate? Rotate? Now is the time to experiment and dust off those cobwebs. And. most importantly, *have fun!*

**Due October 3 at 10:00 a.m.** Be prepared to present your site and discuss the techniques you experimented with and why you chose them.

# Assignment 2 - Regular Expressions

Watch Daniel Shiffman's [series on regular expressions](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YEypLuls7iidwHMdCM6o2w). 

September 19 marks International Talk Like A Pirate Day. Although we missed it this year, your assignment is to create a web page that, when given a sample of text, will return that text translated into pirate-speak. See [talklikeapirate.com](http://talklikeapirate.com/wordpress/) for help translating the text. Your page should take the text in either through a textbox or via a file upload if you prefer and should then manipulate the text using regular expressions. Your page should be formatted appropriately in a pirate-y theme.

**Due October 12 at 10:00 a.m.**

# Assignment 3 - GitHub and Holy Grail

Watch Daniel Shiffman's [series on Git and Github](https://youtu.be/BCQHnlnPusY?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV).

Create a Github account and post all the assignments you've done so far to it, then email me a link to your repos so I can view and grade them.

**Due October 14 by 12:00 p.m.**

Next, watch The Net Ninja's [series on CSS Flexbox](https://youtu.be/Y8zMYaD1bz0?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9i3FXJSUfmsNOx8E7u6UuhG). Flexbox is a new CSS module that gives us a new mechanism for laying out content on our pages. As [caniuse.com](http://caniuse.com/#search=flexbox) tells us has broad support today. If you remember the pain of laying elements out with `position` and `float` then you'll see why flexbos is so exciting!

Build a web page using flexbox for layout that creates a [Holy Grail design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Grail_(web_design)). Your content area should contain enough content to cause the page to scroll at least one screenfull. Use real content, perhaps your Miss Baker work? For an extra challenge use CSS Columns to format your content into newspaper-like columns that wrap and fill your page neatly. You page should also be responsive and work equally well on large, small, and mobile screens.

Using the Miss Baker site we developed in class (and available in a repo on Github): 

* add at least two JavaScript files to your page, be sure to use ES6 functionality to perform whatever operations you decide on
* write Gulp task(s) that monitor your JavaScript for changes and upon seeing them runs babel to transpile to ES5, bundles them, and minifies them (be sure to link to the bundled JS file in your index.html file
* optimize all the images in the `images` folder and write them to `dist\images`
