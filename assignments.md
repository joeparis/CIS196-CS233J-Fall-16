## Miss Baker ##
This first assignment is meant to ease you into
Using the text and image provided in the `miss_baker` directory of this repo create a web page using symantic HTML. Be sure to mark up the page fully and don't be afraid of over complicating it. Visit the [MDN HTML Element Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) to refresh your memory. Look for opportunities to use tags you never have before.

Also, style your page using CSS. Again, the [MDN CSS page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) is your friend. Apply styles to format the page. Try adding dropcaps or extra large first letters where they seem appropriate. Use CSS to make interesting changes to your page such as adding animations or transitions. Do you remember how to use transform? Translate? Rotate? Now is the time to experiment and dust off those cobwebs. And. most importantly, *have fun!*

** Due October 3. ** Be prepared to present your site and discuss the techniques you experimented with and why you chose them.
