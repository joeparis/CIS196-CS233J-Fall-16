# Miss Baker
This first assignment is meant to ease you into back into things. Using the text and image provided in the `miss_baker` directory of this repo create a web page using symantic HTML. Be sure to mark up the page fully and don't be afraid of over complicating it. Visit the [MDN HTML Element Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) to refresh your memory. Look for opportunities to use tags you never have before.

Also, style your page using CSS. Again, the [MDN CSS page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) is your friend. Apply styles to format the page. Try adding dropcaps or extra large first letters where they seem appropriate. Use CSS to make interesting changes to your page such as adding animations or transitions. Do you remember how to use transform? Translate? Rotate? Now is the time to experiment and dust off those cobwebs. And. most importantly, *have fun!*

**Due October 3 at 10:00 a.m.** Be prepared to present your site and discuss the techniques you experimented with and why you chose them.

# Regular Expressions

Watch Daniel Shiffman's [series on regular expressions](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YEypLuls7iidwHMdCM6o2w). 

September 19 marks International Talk Like A Pirate Day. Although we missed it this year, your assignment is to create a web page that, when given a sample of text, will return that text translated into pirate-speak. See [talklikeapirate.com](http://talklikeapirate.com/wordpress/) for help translating the text. Your page should take the text in either through a textbox or via a file upload if you prefer and should then manipulate the text using regular expressions. Your page should be formatted appropriately in a pirate-y theme.

**Due October 12 at 10:00 a.m.**
